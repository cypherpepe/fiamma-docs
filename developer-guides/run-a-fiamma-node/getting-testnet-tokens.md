# Getting Testnet Tokens

## Create a Keyring <a href="#id-1-create-a-keyring" id="id-1-create-a-keyring"></a>

One can create a keyring through the `fiammad keys add` command.

```
# Replace the --keyring-backend argument with a backend of your choice
fiammad --keyring-backend test keys add my-key
```

This will output an address and a memo. Record the memo as it is the only way to recover your key if it gets lost. &#x20;

For more commands about keys, you can refer to the [Manage Keys ](../../user-guides/manage-keys.md)
