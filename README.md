# Overview

Founded by seasoned ZK (zero-knowledge) developers, researchers, and strategists in fintech and crypto, we are the first to enable Bitcoin to verify ZKPs optimistically under the BitVM2 paradigm. We hold a deep conviction that ZK technology is the key to unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential.

One of the most powerful features of ZK technology is its ability to compress complex computations into small, constant-size proofs that can be easily verified on blockchains. This is the mechanism behind ZK-rollups, which help scale Ethereum. While Bitcoin remains the most valuable and secure blockchain, its limited programmability restricts it from supporting the broad range of applications found on other networks. Another crucial advantage of ZK technology is enabling trustless interoperability between blockchains.&#x20;

We are developing infrastructure including **Fiamma Bridge** (pragmatically trustless BitVM Bitcoin bridges), **Fiamma Layer** (a BitVM-Powered ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) Verification Layer), and additional foundational tools to support a thriving, diverse Bitcoin ecosystem.

Our infrastructures empower BTC holders to earn trustless yields and explore limitless ecosystems like never before. We’re unlocking native, trustless access to Bitcoin’s immense liquidity for all ecosystems, creating unprecedented opportunities. Developers can now innovate freely on Bitcoin beyond EVM or SVM, shaping a future where Bitcoin serves as the foundation for boundless potential.
