# BitVM-Powered ZKP Verification Layer

Founded by seasoned ZK (zero-knowledge) developers, researchers, and strategists in fintech and crypto, we are the first to enable Bitcoin to verify ZKPs optimistically under the BitVM2 paradigm. We hold a deep conviction that ZK technology is the key to unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential.

We are developing infrastructure including pragmatically trustless BitVM Bitcoin bridges, a BitVM-Powered ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) Verification Layer, and additional foundational tools to support a thriving, diverse Bitcoin ecosystem.

Our infrastructures empower BTC holders to earn trustless yields and explore limitless ecosystems like never before. We’re unlocking native, trustless access to Bitcoin’s immense liquidity for all ecosystems, creating unprecedented opportunities. Developers can now innovate freely on Bitcoin beyond EVM or SVM, shaping a future where Bitcoin serves as the foundation for boundless potential.

Fiamma's ZKP Verification Layer on Bitcoin is the first-ever implementation of BitVM2, enabling ZK use cases to be verified and settled on Bitcoin for the first time, harnessing Bitcoin's unmatched security. By integrating with Babylon and implementing BitVM2, the verification layer offers both fast and hard finality, leveraging Bitcoin's robust cryptoeconomic and network security. This is a foundational tool for democratizing Bitcoin security, making it accessible to a broader range of applications and users.
